## ml_new_mexico

# Plan of Action
- Build a GRU (Gated-Recurrent-Unit) that takes all types of data as input over the last 40ish years (CO2, NO2 levels etc.) also including socio-economic data and then consider the average temperature in New Mexico. 

- Using regression methods, predict what the chosen parameters could like look in the near future and use this to predict, using the trained GRU what the temperature in the near future might look like. 

- Additionally, if there is time and motivation, use image data, parsing it through a CNN, or another kind of deep-learning model and add into your input data to provide additional predictive power.

Run the `setup.sh` script using the command below. Ensure that your conda installation is installed and sourced. 

```
./setup.sh
